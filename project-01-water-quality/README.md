# Project 01 — Water Quality Analytics Dashboard

## 🌊 Overview
This project analyzes water quality data from publicly available environmental datasets (USGS/EPA). The goal is to identify trends in pH, contaminants, nutrient loading, and overall water health across monitoring sites. The project will culminate in a Power BI dashboard that visualizes site conditions and highlights environmental patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate water quality trends over time (pH, turbidity, nitrates, dissolved oxygen)
- Identify contamination events and abnormal readings
- Compare water quality across geographic locations
- Create a Water Quality Index (WQI) metric for easier interpretation
- Build a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to communicate insights

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- SQL querying (filtering, grouping, joining)
- Power BI data modeling & visualization  
- KPI creation and environmental scoring  
- Trend and seasonal analysis  
- Scientific interpretation of environmental data  

## 📂 Planned Project Structure
- **/data/** – raw and cleaned datasets  
- **/sql/** – SQL queries used for analysis  
- **/notebooks/** – optional Jupyter/analysis notes  
- **/powerbi/** – dashboard files  
- **/images/** – screenshots for portfolio display  

## 🔍 Project Status
- Dataset selection in progress  
- Environment setup underway  
- Initial data exploration starting soon  

## 📌 Notes
This project leverages my biology and earth science background to demonstrate environmental data analysis, scientific reasoning, and dashboard storytelling.
